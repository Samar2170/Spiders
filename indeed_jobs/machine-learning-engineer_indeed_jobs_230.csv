Whether it is thinking about scaling our architecture, getting your hands dirty with data-crunching or basic code, or finding novel insights for us to apply in creating self-managing communities through smart technology, your KPI will be the reduction in the ratio of human power needed to serve the citizens and businesses in our network. You will be responsible for our infrastructure, data, and algorithm layers. It’s a huge responsibility for the right visionary who has the experience to backup their ideas with rapid delivery.
Required Skills:
Architecture on the Cloud - You have deployed the latest plug-and-play infrastructure products to help rapidly growing startups scale. Evaluating the applicability and appropriateness of these solutions is second nature to you. Navigating the latest and greatest of AWS is child’s play. You have a track record of building stable and scalable back-end infrastructure. .
Security - Cloud and open-source are great but you understand the security and privacy concerns that accompany this wave and have deployed successful solutions to address these. We’re not just talking about just databases.
Data, Data, Data!!! - You live, breathe, and are obsessed with how to capture, store, and utilize data. Your first response to requests for something new are to sketch out diagrams of how the request would integrate with current architecture or what additional layers it would require. You’ve taken ownership of entire data flows in past organizations and are adept at translating ideas into prototypes overnight.
Optimization - A large part of what we do involves improving efficiency under various constraints.You need to be adept at algorithms and foster a deep interest in creating the foundation for cognitive computing and machine learning to thrive.
Team Builder - It’s not just about your individual talents - you’ve developed a team around creating intuitive and addictive user experiences and can channel the potential from young talent toward on-time and amazing products
Still a coder - Ready to get your hands dirty with code and taking responsibility for all aspects of launching new products.
Up for the Challenge - Working on a platform with multiple products is exciting to you and you can handle the multiple deadlines and integration challenges that accompany this style of working.
Startup Growth - You’ve taken products, companies, and teams at mobile and ideally logistics-related startups from Level 3 to Level 10 before and are wise about how to handle growth, when to ditch old code, and prioritize what needs to get done today and what can wait a few more months.
Respect for Experience - You’re not just an engineer who loves to work on the latest and greatest technology. What drives you is the kind of experience your code, architecture, and stack create, the feelings your users experience. You don’t necessarily need to design UI yourself but you should have respect and humility for user capacity and treat is as the key constraint to what we deploy.
Tech stack agnostic - What tools we’re using only matters to you at a level of optimization, efficiency, and future capability. Other than this, you should feel comfortable switching between languages and frameworks with a broad exposure to multiple toolsets. Use of Clojure and other functional programming languages is a bonus.
Nice to have:
Geospatial Data - Experience with geospatial data and interfaces, especially leveraging open source resources.
Supply Chain/Logistics - Track record of building products in the logistics, hyper-local delivery, or supply chain management space with a broad range of users and multiple integrations with external tools, including payment gateways and social media sign-in’s.
Data Visualization - Data visualization expertise and background of simplifying analytics.
Telephony - Integration experience with telephony providers (SMS, IVR, etc.).
Hardware/Sensors - Hardware integration with sensors, mobile add-ons, and other technologies in the Smart Cities space.
Waste Management - Passion for the waste management space and an intuitive understanding of on-ground realities that constrain technology options."

We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Why Cisco:
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Citizengage",N.A,Citizengage,"You will build the foundation for
us to emerge as one India’s leading cognitive computing
companies. Whether it is thinking about scaling our architecture,
getting your hands dirty with data-crunching or basic code, or
finding novel insights for us to apply in creating self-managing
communities through smart technology, your KPI will be the
reduction in the ratio of human power needed to serve the
citizens and businesses in our network. You will be responsible
for our infrastructure, data, and algorithm layers. It’s a huge
responsibility for the right visionary who has the experience to
backup their ideas with rapid delivery.

Required Skills:
Architecture on the Cloud - You have deployed the
latest plug-and-play infrastructure products to help rapidly
growing startups scale. Evaluating the applicability and
appropriateness of these solutions is second nature to you.
Navigating the latest and greatest of AWS is child’s play. You
have a track record of building stable and scalable back-end
infrastructure. .

Security - Cloud and open-source are great but
you understand the security and privacy concerns that accompany
this wave and have deployed successful solutions to address
these. We’re not just talking about just databases.

Data, Data, Data!!! - You live, breathe, and are
obsessed with how to capture, store, and utilize data. Your
first response to requests for something new are to sketch out
diagrams of how the request would integrate with current
architecture or what additional layers it would require. You’ve
taken ownership of entire data flows in past organizations and
are adept at translating ideas into prototypes overnight.

Optimization - A large part of what we do
involves improving efficiency under various constraints.You need
to be adept at algorithms and foster a deep interest in creating
the foundation for cognitive computing and machine learning to
thrive.

Team Builder - It’s not just about your
individual talents - you’ve developed a team around creating
intuitive and addictive user experiences and can channel the
potential from young talent toward on-time and amazing products

Still a coder - Ready to get your hands dirty
with code and taking responsibility for all aspects of launching
new products.

Up for the Challenge - Working on a platform with
multiple products is exciting to you and you can handle the
multiple deadlines and integration challenges that accompany
this style of working.

Startup Growth - You’ve taken products,
companies, and teams at mobile and ideally logistics-related
startups from Level 3 to Level 10 before and are wise about how
to handle growth, when to ditch old code, and prioritize what
needs to get done today and what can wait a few more months.

Respect for Experience - You’re not just an
engineer who loves to work on the latest and greatest
technology. What drives you is the kind of experience your code,
architecture, and stack create, the feelings your users
experience. You don’t necessarily need to design UI yourself but
you should have respect and humility for user capacity and treat
is as the key constraint to what we deploy.

Tech stack agnostic - What tools we’re using only
matters to you at a level of optimization, efficiency, and
future capability. Other than this, you should feel comfortable
switching between languages and frameworks with a broad exposure
to multiple toolsets. Use of Clojure and other functional
programming languages is a bonus.

Nice to have:
Geospatial Data - Experience with geospatial data
and interfaces, especially leveraging open source resources.

Supply Chain/Logistics - Track record of building
products in the logistics, hyper-local delivery, or supply chain
management space with a broad range of users and multiple
integrations with external tools, including payment gateways and
social media sign-in’s.

Data Visualization - Data visualization expertise
and background of simplifying analytics.

Telephony - Integration experience with telephony
providers (SMS, IVR, etc.).

Hardware/Sensors - Hardware integration with
sensors, mobile add-ons, and other technologies in the Smart
Cities space.

management space and an intuitive understanding of on-ground
realities that constrain technology options."
